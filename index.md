## THINGS TO THINK ABOUT:
**New Opening Number:** We will test this out on Friday. Objectives moving forward are to simplify so it doesn't have to be rehearsed as much and make it more concise.  
**Auditions** Please continue to share audition information with your friends. Auditions will be October 7 and 14 at the church. They can send me an email to book a slot. They will need to prepare a song and a monologue.   
**Cast list is now up for shows** You should have all received a link to the folder!  
**Hand billing before shows** You will be contacted by Dallas to do some hand billing before shows to help our houses get bigger.  
**Marketing/Promotion Assistant** We have had some interest in the position for social media marketing so we will be speaking to those that have come forward with more details. If you are interested and haven't let us know, please do so!  
**Shows in the new year** If you have any ideas for shows in the new year, let me know asap.  

## INTERNAL OPPORTUNITIES:
**Bingo/Fundraising:** If you know of anyone who can volunteer for bingo or if you have any fundraising ideas let us know.  
**Curtain Warmer:** In between acts, if you have a stand up bit or a sketch you want to try out there is a 2 minute slot before second half. Curtain warmer welcomes back the second half. (** Opportunity for us to outreach to other companies to perform a bit)  
**Christmas Carolling and Hand billing** If you are interested in Christmas Caroling and handbilling before our Winter Wonderland show, please let Mhairi know. Date: December 15 from 6-7pm.  
**Voice Sessions** I will be offering short voice sessions for the cast. If this is something you are interested in, please let Mhairi know!  

## EXTERNAL OPPORTUNITIES:
