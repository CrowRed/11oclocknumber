## U

## V
**Volley:** The "volley" is the set up rhyme for the "spike" rhyme. If the theme is ocean and you want someone else to rhyme with "shark" your volley word is to set up someone else to say "shark".   
Steps to volley and spike:  
1) Once you know theme of song, begin associating words. Choose a word that you will volley to your partner. For this example the theme is ocean and the associated word is shark.  
2) Set up your volley by finding a word that rhymes with shark. The Volley-er will NOT say shark but say the volley rhyme. Let's make the volley dark.  
3) Sing a phrase that ends with your volley word dark. For example: They are swimming in the ocean where it is so dark.  
4) Partner then "spikes" with the associated word. For example: I hope I can swim faster than all those sharks.  

# Rules
**Rules of a chorus:** Must have phrase repetition & must be about main idea of song. Repeat the chorus until everyone knows it, which may be more than just twice. The creator of the phrase is the teacher of the phrase upon repetition.  
**Character voices:** Use voices that are interesting but don't  hinder  our speaking or singing abilities. Have the same voice for singing and speaking as a character. Keep the voice consistent and don't drop it over the course of a scene/show.
