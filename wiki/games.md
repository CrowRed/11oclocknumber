# Games and Exercises

## Improv Games
**3 Line Game:** Sets up who we are, relationship, location, what we're doing in 3 lines.  
**Endowing game:** Open scene, each line must endow the other character. Working on narrowing the scene as opposed to broadening it.  
**Here Comes Jack:** Two characters are on stage endowing a character who is offstage. We get all of our basic information out about the scene right away and then play the game of constantly endowing a character until they come on stage using all the offers.  
**The Impossible Improv Game**
 Rules: 
1. Don't talk about someone who isn't there  
2. Don't talk about what you are doing  
3. Don't ask questions  
4. Don't break character (laugh)  
5. Don't piss me off  
**It's Tuesday:** Character enters and says "It's Tuesday" in 2 more lines we set up who we are, relationship, location, what we are doing.  
**Typewriter:**  One character narrates from that side as if they are writing the scene. Both scene members and narrator create offers. Looking for the first unusual thing.  



## Musical Games
**Accordion (Musical Space Jump):** There is 1 theme that is used to build up the scenes. Scenes are built with 1 character on stage, when ready a second character will clap in and change the scene (still working off the theme). This continues until eventually all actors are onstage. Singing begins with a main chorus that can be song over each scene (think Les Mis). The character that initialized each scene is in charge of singing a verse. Chorus can be tagged at the end of each scene. We continue until we are left with just one person again.  
**Musical Armando:** Scenes + songs based off of monologue.  
**Musical Correspondence:** Correspondence that leads to a date where the characters sing.  
**Square Dance:** Four square with singing, sing as soon as musician starts playing.  

## Songs
**Opening Number (Life as a Musical):** Ask for occupation, choose most obvious location for that occupation to take place. Begin with scene painting. All involved in song are the same character (all nurses or all marines etc.) Chorus establishes location, verses continue painting. Working on clumps and building a dance break the same way a chorus is built.  
**Location Song:** A song that paints and outlines a particular place. Often, the actors are singing this song as narrators. See 'Opening Number'.  

## Formats
### Life as a Musical Format: (thus far)

1. Opening Number: Sets up location. All characters are the same  
2. Here Comes "___": 2 friends set up with three line game. They then introduce the main character and play "here comes Jack" to endow them. We want to find out what the main character is passionate about and hint at their achilles heel.  
3. Question of the Play: Main character comes on stage. 2 friends find a reason to leave. Main character sets up the question of the play with an "I want song"  
4. Love Interest : We see a scene with love interest and a secondary character. The love interests job is to set up 2 things: 1) Something that would make them right for the main character 2) Something that would cause friction. End scene with song  
5. Begin Ping Pong Match: Question of the play. Raising the stakes  

*Aim for a song in each scene of the ping pong match before finale  

6. Finale: Did character get what they wanted  

### Stranger Things

- Something unusual needs to happen. Go with the first unusual thing.
- Simpler is better 
- Play into the tropes
- Allow characters to die and to dissapear
