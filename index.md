## NEW WORKSHOP FORMAT:
Workshops will consist of:
- Check in
- Work basics
- Mixer games
- Long form
- New skills
- Check out

## THINGS TO THINK ABOUT:

**Opening Number:** How we can include ritual, audience participation, improv  
**Curtain Warmer:** In between acts, if you have a stand up bit or a sketch you want to try out there is a 2 minute slot before second half. Curtain warmer welcomes back the second half. (** Opportunity for us to outreach to other companies to perform a bit)  
**Field Trips:** If you know of any improv happening in the city we will set up a time to go as a group to further our outreach  
**Bingo/Fundraising:** If you know of anyone who can volunteer for bingo or if you have any fundraising ideas let us know.
